# SESNspectraPCA

This repository contains the code for running the PCA + SVM spectral analysis on Stripped-Envelope Core-Collapse Supernovae found in Williamson et al. (2019). There are also data products associated with the new SNID templates that were added to the SESNe spectral library compiled from (Liu et al. 2016)[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...90L] and (Modjaz et al. 2016)[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...832..108M].
