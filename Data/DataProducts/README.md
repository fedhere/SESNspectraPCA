DatasetX.pickle contains the preprocessed set of spectra at phase = X +/- 5 days relative to the date of V-band maximum. Each dataset is a pickled SNIDdataset object, and each SNIDdataset object is a dictionary of SNIDsn objects. The SNIDdataset.py and SNIDsn.py files are located in the /code directory.
